    <p>Extract:
        The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the ocean, casting a golden hue over the horizon. Susan stood on the beach, feeling the cool sand between her toes and the salty breeze in her hair. It was her first solo trip to the seaside, and she was excited to explore all that the small coastal town had to offer.

        As she walked along the shoreline, she noticed a strange rock formation jutting out of the water, almost like a small island. Curiosity getting the best of her, she decided to wade out to get a closer look.
        
        As she approached the rocks, she noticed that they were covered in strange markings that she couldn't quite decipher. It was as if they had been carved by some unknown civilization, with symbols and figures that were both familiar and foreign.
        
        As she stood there, admiring the beauty of the rock formation, she heard a faint whisper in the wind. It was almost as if someone was trying to communicate with her, but she couldn't make out the words.
        
        Suddenly, a strong gust of wind knocked her off balance, and she found herself being pulled under the water. She struggled to stay afloat, but the current was too strong, and she was pulled further out to sea.
        
        Just when she thought she couldn't hold on any longer, a hand reached out and pulled her to safety. It was a fisherman who had been out at sea, and had spotted her struggling in the water.
        
        As she caught her breath, she noticed that the fisherman was looking at her with a mixture of awe and fear. It was then that she realized that the markings on the rock formation were not just any symbols, but ones that had been passed down through generations of fishermen as a warning of the dangers of the sea.
        
        She thanked the fisherman for saving her life, and made her way back to the shore, humbled by the power of the ocean and the mysteries that lay hidden beneath its surface.
