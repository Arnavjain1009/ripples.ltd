    <p>Extract:

        Sarah had been training for a marathon for months. She had always been a runner and loved the challenge and the sense of accomplishment that came with running long distances. But training for a marathon was a whole different level of commitment and dedication. Sarah had to wake up early every day to fit in her training runs, often sacrificing social outings or time with friends and family. She also had to pay close attention to her diet and make sure she was fueling her body properly for the intense workouts. As the marathon drew closer, Sarah began to feel nervous and anxious. She wondered if she had trained enough and if she was really ready for the challenge ahead.</p>
