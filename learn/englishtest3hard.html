    <p>Extract:
        As the sun began to set over the horizon, John found himself lost in the dense forest. He had been hiking all day and had lost track of time, and now the fading light made it difficult for him to see. Panic started to set in as he realized that he didn't know how to find his way back to the trailhead. His phone had no signal, and he had forgotten to bring a map.

        He tried retracing his steps, but every direction looked the same, and the forest seemed to stretch on endlessly. The rustling of leaves and the sound of nocturnal animals in the distance only added to his growing sense of dread.
        
        Just when he thought all hope was lost, he saw a faint light in the distance. At first, he thought it was just his imagination, but as he got closer, he realized it was a campfire. Relief flooded over him as he hurried towards the light.
        
        As he approached the campfire, he saw a group of people gathered around it. They were all dressed in strange clothes and spoke in a language he didn't recognize. They looked at him with suspicion as he stumbled into their midst, but one of them gestured for him to sit by the fire.
        
        John didn't know what to do. He was grateful for the warmth of the fire, but he felt uneasy in the company of strangers. As the night went on, he tried to communicate with them, but their language barrier proved too great.
        
        It was only when one of them pointed to the stars that John realized they were lost travelers like him. They had been wandering the forest for days, trying to find their way home. In that moment, John felt a sense of camaraderie with them, and they all sat around the fire, sharing stories of their adventures and misadventures.
        
        As the night wore on, John felt himself growing tired, and he lay down by the fire, his new companions surrounding him. As he drifted off to sleep, he knew that even though he was lost in the forest, he was no longer alone.
