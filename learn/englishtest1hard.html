    <p>Extract:

        It was a balmy summer afternoon, and Jane was strolling along the boulevard, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling city. She had always loved walking in the city, with its vibrant energy and endless possibilities. But today, as she made her way past the crowds and street vendors, she began to feel a sense of unease creeping over her.

        It started as a faint whisper at the back of her mind, but soon grew into a gnawing feeling of dread. She tried to shake it off, telling herself that it was just her imagination playing tricks on her, but the feeling persisted. It was as if there was someone following her, watching her every move.
        
        She quickened her pace, hoping to leave the feeling behind, but the more she walked, the stronger it became. It was as if the city had turned against her, with its neon lights and honking cars closing in on her from all sides.
        
        Finally, she reached the entrance to the park, and hurried inside, hoping to find some respite from the chaos of the city. But even here, the feeling of unease didn't leave her. She felt as if the trees were closing in on her, and the rustling of leaves sounded like whispers.
        
        As she walked deeper into the park to hide, she saw a figure in the distance, standing motionless beneath a tree. At first, she thought it was a statue, but as she got closer, she realized it was a person. The figure was dressed in a dark cloak, and its face was hidden in the shadows.
        
        Jane hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should approach the figure. But something inside her compelled her forward, and she found herself standing before the mysterious stranger. They stood in silence for a moment, before the figure finally spoke.
        
        "Jane," it said, in a voice that sent shivers down her spine. "You have been chosen. You must come with me."
        
        Jane felt a surge of fear and confusion. She didn't know who this person was, or what they wanted with her. But she also felt a strange sense of curiosity, and a nagging feeling that she couldn't ignore.
        
        She took a deep breath, and followed the figure into the shadows, into a world that she never could have imagined.</p>
