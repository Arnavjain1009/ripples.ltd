    <p>Extract:

        Mrs. Johnson had been a teacher at Greenfield Elementary for nearly 20 years, and she had always loved her job. She loved teaching young children, watching them learn and grow, and helping them discover their passions and talents. But lately, Mrs. Johnson had been feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. It seemed like every day there was a new mandate or policy from the district or the state, and she was struggling to keep up with all the paperwork and bureaucracy. She was spending more and more time on administrative tasks and less time on teaching, which was the reason she had become a teacher in the first place. Mrs. Johnson knew she needed to make a change, but she wasn't sure what to do.</p>
