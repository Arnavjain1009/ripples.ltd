    <p>Extract:
        It was a crisp autumn evening, and the leaves on the trees were a riot of colors. Emma had always loved this time of year, with its cozy sweaters, warm apple cider, and the promise of Halloween just around the corner. She was walking home from work, lost in thought, when she heard a strange noise coming from the bushes ahead.

        At first, she thought it was just an animal, maybe a squirrel or a raccoon. But as the noise grew louder, she realized that it was something else entirely. It sounded like someone was crying, their sobs muffled by the leaves and branches.
        
        Emma hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should investigate. But something in the sound of the crying tugged at her heartstrings, and she felt compelled to help. She pushed her way through the bushes, and found herself in a small clearing, where she saw a girl huddled on the ground, her face buried in her hands.
        
        "Are you okay?" Emma asked, approaching cautiously. The girl looked up, startled, and Emma saw that she was no more than a teenager, with tears streaming down her face.
        
        "I'm fine," the girl said, but her voice was thick with emotion. "I just needed to be alone for a little while."
        
        Emma didn't believe her, but she also didn't want to pry. Instead, she sat down next to the girl, and together they watched as the sun set over the trees.
