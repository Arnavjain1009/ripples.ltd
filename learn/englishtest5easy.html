    <p>John had always been a shy and introverted person, preferring to spend most of his time alone rather than socializing with others. He had a few close friends, but even with them, he found it hard to open up and share his thoughts and feelings. It wasn't until John started taking acting classes that he realized how much he had been missing out on. Through acting, John was able to step outside of his comfort zone and try on different personas and characters. He found that he could express himself in ways he had never imagined before, and that the fear of being judged or rejected started to fade away. John started to feel more confident and self-assured, and he found that this newfound sense of self carried over into other areas of his life as well.
