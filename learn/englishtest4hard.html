    <p>Extract:
        It was a misty morning in the small town of Millfield, and Mary was walking to the market. The town was quiet, with only a few early risers out and about. As Mary passed by the old mill, she noticed a figure standing in the shadows. At first, she thought it was just a trick of the light, but as she got closer, she saw that it was a man.

        He was tall and thin, with a pale face and dark hair. He wore a long coat that seemed to swallow him up, and he held a cane in one hand. Mary hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should approach him. But as she got closer, she saw that he was shivering, despite the warm coat.
        
        "Excuse me," Mary said, "are you okay? Do you need some help?"
        
        The man looked up at her, and his eyes seemed to glow in the dim light. "Yes," he said, in a low voice. "I am lost. Can you show me the way?"
        
        Mary felt a surge of fear, but also a twinge of pity. She didn't know who this man was, or what he wanted. But she couldn't just leave him there, lost and alone.
        
        "Sure," she said, with a small smile. "Where do you need to go?"
        
        The man hesitated, as if he didn't want to say. But finally, he spoke. "To the old cemetery, on the outskirts of town. I need to find a grave."
        
        Mary's heart skipped a beat. The old cemetery was rumored to be haunted, and few people ventured there, especially not alone. But she couldn't just leave the man there, lost and shivering.
        
        "Okay," she said, trying to sound brave. "I'll show you the way."
