            <h2>1. The Grand Ship: A Floating Palace</h2>
            <p>The Titanic was a luxury ocean liner, the epitome of elegance and opulence.</p>
            <p><strong>1.1 Design and Dimensions</strong></p>
            <p>The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p>It stood 882 feet and 9 inches long, with a beam of 92 feet and 6 inches.</p>
            <p>The ship’s gross tonnage was approximately 46,000 tons.</p>
            <p>It featured four towering funnels, although only three were functional—the fourth was for aesthetics.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2 First-Class Splendor</strong></p>
            <p>First-class passengers reveled in luxury. Their staterooms resembled elegant hotel suites, complete with plush carpets, mahogany furniture, and private bathrooms.</p>
            <p>The Grand Staircase, adorned with oak paneling, stained glass, and a wrought-iron balustrade, was a focal point.</p>
            <p>The À la carte restaurant, the Verandah Café, and the Reading and Writing Room catered to the elite.</p>
            <p>The Promenade Deck offered breathtaking views of the open sea.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3 Second and Third Class</strong></p>
            <p>Second-class passengers enjoyed comfortable accommodations, while third-class travelers faced more modest conditions.</p>
            <p>Third-class berths were functional but lacked the grandeur of the upper decks.</p>
            <p>The Third-Class Dining Saloon served hearty meals to the working-class passengers.</p>

            <p>At 11:40 PM, the Titanic struck an iceberg on the starboard side.</p>
            <p>The impact caused a series of fatal punctures along the hull.</p>
            <p>Water flooded the compartments, leading to the ship’s gradual descent.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3 Evacuation and Lifeboats</strong></p>
            <p>The crew began loading lifeboats, but there were not enough for all passengers.</p>
            <p>The women and children first policy was enforced, prioritizing their safety.</p>
            <p>Only 705 of the 2,224 passengers and crew survived.</p>
